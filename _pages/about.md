Hi, we are Horee, a coding community based in <strong>Serpong</strong>, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. It is a free community. In here we share, learn the latest various technologies, we also collaborate to build something usefull and also unusefull things LoL. As the name Horee means Hurray in English word, we learn coding with a fun way, we use public places such as cafe, or outdoor places to discuss and learn coding, sometimes we also have outdoor activities such bonfire, touring, running, etc.
